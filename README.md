# LinkPreviewSwift

LinkPreviewSwift is an in-progress implementation of link previews in Swift that works client-side or server-side.

It's not quite ready for usage; I'm still adding support for a few more preview formats.

## Installation

LinkPreviewSwift can be added to your project using Swift Package Manager. For more
information on using SwiftPM in Xcode, see [Apple's guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app)

If you're using package dependencies directly, you can add this as one of your dependencies:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/harlanhaskins/LinkPreviewSwift.git", branch: "main")
]
```
